# About me and ancient bats, rats, and their DNA

Hello! My name is Sindy Luu and welcome to my blog about my research projects and personal journeyings through a PhD and science. The existence of this blog began with my participation of [23 Things 2020](https://23things2020.wordpress.com/), an international universities initiative that connects students and professionals between New Zealand and the United Kingdom. One of the relevant tasks is to create a website and here it is - _ta da_!

## My PhD research
It is 2020 and I am in my final year of my PhD with the University of Otago. I am associated with the [Bioanthropology Research Group of the Department of Anatomy](https://www.otago.ac.nz/anatomy/research/bioanthropology/index.html), and with the [Archaeology programme, School of Social Sciences](https://www.otago.ac.nz/archaeology/index.html).  

My thesis aims to evaluate the potential for the use of Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) methods to engage with age-old archaeological research questions relevant to Near Oceania and the Pacific, dating from 40,000 BP to the mid-Holocene: subsistence strategies, resource use and domestication, migration and trade. It is a techniques-focused project, divided into case studies packed with exciting archaeological and anthropological research questions. Key sites include New Ireland (testing DNA preservation), Kiowa (exploitation of mammals and birds for subsistence and trade), Adele Island (commensal model). At the same time, my thesis will test the preservation potential of ancient DNA in the tropics.

In sum, I study the ancient DNA of bats, rats and other animal bones that were discarded by prehistoric peoples. Then, using this genetic data along with other archaeological and anthropological evidence, I help build the narrative of how our ancestors may have lived and moved across the Pacific landscape, thousands of years ago. It is not just about the past we are interested in too. Both the genetic and archaeological knowledge we gain can be used towards setting a baseline for our present and future biological/ecologial conservation and heritage management efforts.

Who says the past doesn't matter? _Not me!_

## What you might find on this website?
In honesty, I have no clue - it is all fairly new. 

I intend it to be informative about various aspects of my projects and the science behind them. But I also am interested in the personal and reflective processes in learning, being a scientist, and being a postgraduate student in a university institution. One thing that frequently comes out at various workshops on 'How to PhD' or 'How to be a postgraduate', on twitter (\#AcademicChatter is an interesting one to follow), and from lunch time chats with fellow colleagues and friends, is how common yet individualistic our journeys are, and so there will be some posts about my own experiences.

I hope you will find some of these things I will post about insightful and exciting, and welcome aboard!
